# Simple dashboard for Watson web applications

This repository contains all code needed to easily create a dashboard for web applications that use Watson Services.

## Introduction

Each web application needs a simple and intuitive graphic user interface. This solution allows you to use a mixed framework to create a simple and fresh UI for your web apps, and it's based on:

1. Carbon Design System: http://www.carbondesignsystem.com/
2. Material Design Lite: https://getmdl.io/
3. Materialize: https://materializecss.com/

All css/js for graphic purpose is hosted within the web application.

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisite is to have a working PHP application.

## Installation

Copy the contents and start creating your dashboard using examples you find in it.
You will need to edit:
1. admincfg/CheckLogin.php: set username and password to log in to the web application
2. api/ChatBot.php: set workspace id, username and password of Watson Assistant service

## Features

This dashboard features a responsive layout with lateral menu, dropdown menu, mobile drawer and a fixed footer. The dashboard is enabled to integrate a Virtual Assistant powered by Watson Assistant. Please see related tutorials for more info. This dashboard integrates also sweetalert2 (https://sweetalert2.github.io/).
